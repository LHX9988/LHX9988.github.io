I'm Haoxiang Luo, a third-year Ph.D. candidate with the major of Information and Communication Engineering from the [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)), Chengdu, China, advised by Prof. [Hongfang Yu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=GmEdMqwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Gang Sun](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aUPwLyYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

Before that, I obtaied my B.Eng. degree from the [Glasgow College, UESTC](https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/), which is a join programme between the [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and the University of Glasgow ([UoG](https://www.gla.ac.uk/)), UK, under the guidance of Prof. [Weijian Chen](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E4%BC%9F%E5%BB%BA/10235124).

At this moment, my research interests are Blockchain, Internet of Things, Networks, Trustworthy LLM, Energy markets, and so on. Also, I am currently a Visiting Student at the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in Singapore, under the guidance of Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
